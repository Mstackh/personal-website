Families provide the meso-level social context within which advantages and disadvantages are experienced and transmitted across generations (Shuey et al., 2021). Resources present within families during early life have been shown to initiate pathways of adversity or advantage that shape future social, economic, and health outcomes. There is some indication that parent health during early life has long reaching implications for children’s well-being into adulthood. Health limitations may diminish parents’ abilities to provide economic, social, and emotional resources, as well as increase family stress and impact family functioning (e.g., Hardie & Turney, 2017; Shuey, et al., 2021; Turney & Hardie, 2018). Although research finds higher levels of mental health difficulties among children with an ill parent (e.g., Goosby, 2013; Hardie & Turney, 2017), there is an overall lack of research that examines the potentially long-term effects of parental health on the mental health of children into adulthood.
