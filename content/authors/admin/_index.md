I am a PhD Candidate in the department of Sociology at Western University, a CAnD3 fellow, and currently a research associate intern with Environics Analytics. 

My research broadly explores the social determinants of health inequalities. I theoretically draw from medical sociology, life course, demography, and cultural capital perspectives, and employ quantitative methods using longitudinal and cross-sectional data in both Canada and the United States. I often use a range of structural equation modeling techniques such as principal component analysis, factor analysis, and latent profile and class analysis to uncover structural relationships within data and observe heterogeneous groups in a population.

I am particularly interested in how meso-level factors contribute to population health divergences. As a researcher, a central theme in my work is concerned with understanding the effects that family-related factors (e.g., parent-child relationship, family functioning, family structure) have on childrenâ€™s health trajectories as they transition into adulthood and over their life course. I am drawn to further understanding how aspects of the family accentuate or ameliorate the association between social class in childhood and health in later life. 

My research pursuits expand beyond these horizons as I have research experience exploring urban-rural health disparities, social impacts of COVID-19, sexual orientation and health, parenting and children's academic achievement, parental disability pathways toward children's later life health, and environmental sociology more generally.

I am a curious individual who is eager to learn and contribute to theoretical, measurement, and methodological advancements within the life course and medical sociology literature. Publications in which I have co-authored have appeared in _The Canadian Journal of Public Health_, _Canadian Public Policy_, and _SSM - Population Health_.
