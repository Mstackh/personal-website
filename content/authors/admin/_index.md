I am a PhD Candidate in Sociology at Western University. Before pursuing my PhD, I completed an MA in Sociology at Western and a BA (honours) from the University of New Brunswick.

My research includes quantitative methods, longitudinal data analysis, health inequality across the life course, and intergenerational relationships. In order to examine health inequality, I employ several quantitative techniques and make use of cross-sectional and longitudinal data in both Canada and the United States. In particular, I focus on health behaviour and lifestyle trajectories, disparities in mental health, and parental disability as a measure of inequality in childhood. I have experience using a range of modelling techniques such as principal component analysis, factor analysis, latent class analysis, and cluster analysis.

As a researcher, I am passionate about understanding the effects that family-related factors (e.g., parent-child relationship, family functioning, family structure) have on children’s health trajectories as they transition into adulthood and over their life course. I am drawn to further understanding how the family accentuates or ameliorates the association between social class in childhood and health in later life.
